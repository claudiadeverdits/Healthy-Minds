    <p class = "mythsAndFactsDesc"> Despite the prevalence of mental health issues in our society, there are still an overabundance of false beliefs surrounding it. Here are some common myths about mental health: </p> <br>

    <div class = "mythsAndFactsText">

     <p> <b> Myth: People with mental health problems are violent and unpredictable. </b> <br> <br>
     <b> Truth: </b> Most people with mental health problems are not any more violent than anybody else. In reality, people with mental illnesses can be attributed to only 3% to 5% of violent acts. In fact, people with severe mental illnesses are 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than the general population. </p> <br>

      <p> <b> Myth: Mental illnesses aren't real. </b> <br> <br>
     <b> Truth: </b> Many people assume that depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders are not real, undermining sufferers as being "lazy" or "going through a phase". The truth is, many people suffer from mental disabilities, even if their life seems perfect on the outside. People's mental disorders should not be brushed aside or belittled. </p> <br>

    <p> <b> Myth: Mental illnesses are rare. </b> <br> <br>
     <b> Truth: </b> 1 in 4 people will suffer from a mental illness at some point in their life. If a mental illness doesn't affect you personally, it will probably affect someone you love. </p> <br>

    <p> <b> Myth: People with mental illnesses or serious traumas always show their symptoms openly. </b> <br> <br>
     <b> Truth: </b> People suffer privately a lot of time and become skilled at pretending to be fine. It is impossible to gauge people's struggles from their outward demeanor. The truth is, people are really good at pretending to be okay, when most of the time they aren't. </p> <br>
  
      <p> <b> Myth: Depression is just feeling sad all day. </b> <br> <br>
     <b> Truth: </b> Depression comes in many forms and affects each person differently. Again — people are really good at pretending to be okay. </p> <br>

      <p> <b> Myth: Psychological disorders can be inherited. </b> <br> <br>
     <b> Truth: </b> Except for a few exceptions, such as schizophrenia or autism-spectrum disorders, children cannot inherit specific disorders. However, they may inherit a general vulnerability to physchological illnesses. </p> <br>

      <p> <b> Myth: Psychiatric medications are bad. </b>   <br> <br>
     <b> Truth: </b> Mental illnesses are just like any other illness, meaning that they may also require medication. Just like a person with diabetes needs insulin, a person with mental health problems might need to take medicine. The actual safety of psychiatric medicine depends on the dosage and type of medicine, which should always be determined by one's doctor.</p> <br>

     <p> <b> Myth: Teens are just going through a phase. </b> <br> <br>
     <b> Truth: </b> Untreated mental health problems can affect energy level, mood, motivation, and more. During that time, unhealthy behavior patterns can be developed. Remember — mental illnesses are real.  </p>
