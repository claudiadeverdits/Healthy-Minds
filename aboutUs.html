  <div class = "aboutUs">

    <h1> About Us! </h1> <br>

    <p> We are a group of high school and college girls who wanted to use our passion for computer science to help those struggling with their mental health. Mental health is an extremely prevalent aspect of our society that affects a large and diverse part of the population. Despite this, there is a lot of stigma about the topic and many peoples' issues are overlooked. Determined to do something about it, we created Healthy Minds, a website filled with resources about mental health. Read below to learn more about each of us: </p>

    <p>Hi, I'm Claudia! Iâ€™m a rising freshman at the University of Rhode Island studying computer science and business. Mental health activism is something I became interested in throughout my high school years, especially after taking an AP Psychology class my senior year and I hope this website continues the important conversation about mental health and provides as a resource for those that come across it.</p> <br>
